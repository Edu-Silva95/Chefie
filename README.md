# README

This is my second solo project as a junior developer, created to try and use cleaner code I learnt from the courses I attended. Designed and coded by me.
It's a recipe web-site where people can create an account, share recipes, share videos/courses teaching recipes.
Many features included, here are a few:

* Create Account, change password, delete account.
* Like functionality.
* Comment functionality.
* Share recipes and video/courses which can also be deleted by the user that made the post.
* Report functionality.
* Change the user picture.
* Feed system.
* Topics/Discussions.
* Favorite fucntionality.
* Search fucntionality

And more!

Thank you!
